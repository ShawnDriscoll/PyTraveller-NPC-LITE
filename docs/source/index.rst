**PyTravLITE Guide**
====================

What began as a DOS prompt NPC generator escalated into a web-browsed one...

**PyTravLITE** is an easy-to-use open source NPC generator for Mongoose Traveller 1st and 2nd Editions. It's written
in Python 3.9.11 and includes **PyDiceroll 3.6** for its die rolling. Source for **PyDiceroll 3.6** can be found at
its `GitHub
<https://github.com/ShawnDriscoll/pydiceroll/>`__ repository.

**PyTravLITE** features minor logging and error tracking at this time.

This documentation explains how to install and use **PyTravLITE** for Traveller NPC generation.
