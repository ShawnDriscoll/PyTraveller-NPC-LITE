**Installing**
==============

Installing and using **PyTravLITE** seems simple enough. Just download the archive from `GitHub
<https://github.com/ShawnDriscoll/PyTraveller-NPC-LITE/>`__ and extract it to a folder you prefer.

Running PyTravLITE
------------------
If you have Python 3.9.11 installed, you can start ``PyTravLITE.py`` from a CMD prompt or double-click
the Python script.

Alternatively, if you do not have Python 3.9.11, you can start ``PyTravLITE.exe`` (located in the
dist folder) from a CMD prompt or by double-clicking the executable program.
