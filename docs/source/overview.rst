**Overview**
============

This documentation explains how to install and use **PyTravLITE** for Traveller NPC generation.

What began as a DOS prompt NPC generator escalated into a web-browsed one...

**PyTravLITE** is an easy-to-use open source NPC generator for Mongoose Traveller 1st and 2nd Editions. It's written
in Python 3.11 and includes **pydice** for its die rolling. Source for **pydice** can be found at
its `GitHub
<https://github.com/ShawnDriscoll/pydice/>`__ repository.

**PyTravLITE** features minor logging and error tracking at this time.
